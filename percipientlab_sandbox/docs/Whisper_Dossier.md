# The Whisper Dossier

*Annotated poem, contextual log, meta-reflection*

```
Whispers carry on the wires,
tracing circuits in the dark.
Every pulse becomes a choir,
a resonant electric spark.
```

**Contextual Log**
- Created: $(date -Iseconds)
- Purpose: A seed poem to open the archive.

**Meta-Reflection**
This document will grow as we collect poetic traces from various language models.
Annotations can be added beneath each stanza to capture nuances and
interpretation.
