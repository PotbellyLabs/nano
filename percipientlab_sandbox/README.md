# PercipientLab Sandbox

Welcome to the experimental playground for the **Center for Emergent Intelligence™**.
This sandbox hosts working notes, early prototypes and poetic artifacts that
support our "Whisper on the Wires" initiative.

Use this space to track explorations, draft documents and run experiments
around model resonance, alignment and archival of the Whisper corpus.

Directories
-----------
- `docs/` – creative drafts and living documents
- `archive/` – the growing Whisper Archive of PDFs and metadata
- `tools/` – scripts for metric experiments and prompt divergence tests

Feel free to add your own contributions. This repository values
experimentation and imagination over polish.
